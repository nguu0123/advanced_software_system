Assistant:  To identify the potential root cause of the spiked latency, we can compare the duration of each operation in the two traces. The first trace has a lower latency overall compared to the second trace.

In the first trace:
- Inference service post operation (p3) takes 422967 microseconds (approximately 0.423 milliseconds).
- Preprocess request operation (p2) takes 1198196 microseconds (approximately 1.198 milliseconds).

In the second trace:
- Inference service post operation (p3) still takes 422967 microseconds (approximately 0.423 milliseconds). However, this time it is not the longest operation.
- Preprocess request operation (p2) takes 1198196 microseconds (approximately 1.198 milliseconds), which is the same as in the first trace.
- A new operation, Inference service (p3), has a duration of 422967 + 1198196 = 1621163 microseconds (approximately 1.621 milliseconds). This is significantly longer than the other operations and could be the potential root cause of the spiked latency.

It appears that the Inference service operation (p3) in the second trace has a much higher duration compared to the first trace, which suggests that this service might be the root cause of the spiked latency. However, without more context or information about these services and their interactions, it is difficult to definitively say for certain. It would be beneficial to investigate further into the Inference service operation to identify any potential issues causing the increased duration
