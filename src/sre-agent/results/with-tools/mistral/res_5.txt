Assistant:  Based on the provided traces, it appears that the latency spike might be related to the "inference-service" (service with ID p3). Here's why:

1. The first trace shows a normal response time for both the web server (p1) and preprocessor (p2) services. However, in the second trace, there is a significant increase in the duration of the "inference-service-post" operation (related to service p3), which corresponds to the inference process.

2. The increased duration for the "inference-service-post" operation suggests that the inference process might be taking longer than usual, causing the overall latency to spike. This is supported by the logs within this operation showing events like "Starting inference", "Inference completed", and no results being returned, which could indicate a problem with the inference model or data processing.

3. The other services (web server and preprocessor) seem to be functioning normally, as indicated by their response times remaining consistent between the two traces.

However, it's important to note that this analysis is based on the information provided in the traces, and further investigation might be required to confirm the root cause of the latency spike. For example, you could check if there are any changes in the data being processed, issues with the inference model, or resource constraints affecting the "inference-service"
