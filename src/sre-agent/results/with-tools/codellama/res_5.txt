Both traces are showing a spike in latency, but they differ in their structure and provide different insights into the issue.

The first trace shows a single span with a long duration, indicating that the entire request took a long time to process. This could be due to various factors such as high CPU usage, network issues, or database performance issues. The root cause of this spike is likely to be found in the "inference-service-post" service.

The second trace shows multiple spans with different durations, indicating that each service took a different amount of time to process its portion of the request. This could indicate that there are bottlenecks or performance issues within individual services. The root cause of this spike is likely to be found in one or more of the "pre-processor", "inference-server", or "web-server" services.

In summary, both traces provide valuable insights into the issue but require different approaches to identify the root cause. The first trace provides a simpler view of the entire request duration and suggests that the root cause is likely to be found in the "inference-service-post" service. The second trace provides a more detailed view of each service's portion of the request and suggests that the root cause may be found in one or more of the "pre-processor", "inference-server", or "web-server" services.%
