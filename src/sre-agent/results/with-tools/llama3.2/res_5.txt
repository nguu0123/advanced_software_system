Assistant: To compare the two traces and determine which service is the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to analyze the spans in each trace.

**Trace 1:**

* `p1` (Web Server) has a span with duration 1207384ms, which is unusually long.
* `p2` (Pre-Processor) has a span with duration 1198196ms, which is also quite long.
* `p3` (Inference Service) has a span with duration 422967ms, which is relatively short compared to the other two services.

**Trace 2:**

* `p1` (Web Server) has a span with duration 1733172697808447ms, which is extremely long and likely caused by a bottleneck.
* `p2` (Pre-Processor) has a span with duration 1733172699015676ms, which is also very long.
* `p3` (Inference Service) has a span with duration 1733172698591295ms, which is relatively short.

Based on these observations:

1. **Web Server (p1)**: The Web Server's span in both traces is unusually long, indicating that it may be the root cause of the spiked latency.
2. **Pre-Processor (p2)**: While the Pre-Processor's span is also long, it seems to be a secondary issue, as its duration is not as extreme as the Web Server's in Trace 1.
3. **Inference Service (p3)**: The Inference Service's span is relatively short and does not appear to be the primary cause of the spiked latency.

To further investigate, you may want to:

* Check the Web Server's logs for any errors or issues that could be causing the long duration.
* Analyze the Pre-Processor's logs to see if there are any bottlenecks or performance issues.
* Use tracing tools to visualize the spans and identify any potential issues with the Inference Service.

By analyzing these traces, you should be able to identify which service is contributing most significantly to the spiked latency.
