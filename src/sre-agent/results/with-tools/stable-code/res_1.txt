The traces provided show different services and operations.

To identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to look at how each service handles requests and responses.

Based on the provided traces:
1. The "web-server" is responsible for handling incoming web requests. It processes these requests by creating a new instance of the requested controller class.
2. The "pre-processor" service is responsible for processing incoming data before it is passed to the actual inference engine. This preprocessing step can include tasks such as data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.
3. The "inference-service" handles the requests that are sent to the inference endpoint of the web server. It processes these requests by passing the relevant input data to the inference engine. The output generated by the inference engine is then returned as a response to the original request.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the "web-server" and "inference-service" are responsible for handling incoming web requests and processing them accordingly. On the other hand, the "pre-processor" service is responsible for preprocessing the input data before passing it to the inference engine.

Overall, based on these traces, we can conclude that the "web-server" and "inference-service" are responsible for handling incoming web requests and processing them accordingly. On the other hand, the "pre-processor" service is responsible for preprocessing the input data before passing it to the inference engine.%
