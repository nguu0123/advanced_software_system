The traces provided show different services and operations. To identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to look at how each service handles data or requests.

Based on the provided traces:
1. The "preprocess-request" operation is triggered by a "CHILD_OF" reference in the trace ID. This suggests that the preprocess-request operation may be responsible for the spiked latency.
2. The "inference-service-post" operation is triggered by a "POST" request to the inference service endpoint. This suggests that the inference-service-post operation may also be responsible for the spiked latency.
3. The "web-server-trace" operation is triggered by a "GET" request to the web server endpoint. This suggests that the web-server-trace operation may not directly contribute to the spiked latency, but it can indirectly affect how other services handle data or requests.

Based on these observations, it seems likely that the root cause of the spiked latency lies in one of the services involved in processing and handling data or requests. Further investigation and analysis of the specific services and their interactions may be necessary to pinpoint the exact root cause of the spiked latency.%
