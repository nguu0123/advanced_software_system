To identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we can compare the two traces and look for any differences in the duration of the spans and the timestamps of the logs. By doing so, we can pinpoint the service that is responsible for the increased latency.

In the normal request trace, the spans have relatively low durations and the timestamps of the logs indicate smooth and timely processing of the request. However, in the spiked latency request trace, the spans have significantly higher durations and the timestamps of the logs indicate delays in processing, particularly in the "inference-service-post" operation.

Based on this comparison, it appears that the "inference-service-post" operation is the root cause of the spiked latency. The increased duration and delayed processing in this operation are likely contributing to the overall latency spike in the request.

Further investigation into the "inference-service-post" operation, including analyzing its performance, resource utilization, and potential bottlenecks, would be necessary to address and resolve the latency issue.
