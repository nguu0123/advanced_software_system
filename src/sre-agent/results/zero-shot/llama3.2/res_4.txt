To compare the two traces and identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to analyze the spans in each trace.

**Trace 1:**

* `preprocess-request` span (ID: `b46c055a40bda3dc`) has a duration of 1198196ms, which is relatively short compared to other spans.
* `inference-span` span (ID: `b46c055a40bda3dc`) also has a duration of 1207384ms, which is significantly longer than the previous span.

This suggests that the `preprocess-request` service is completing quickly, but the `inference-span` service is taking a long time to complete.

**Trace 2:**

* `preprocess-request` span (ID: `add1c5865e982189`) has a duration of 422967ms, which is relatively short compared to other spans.
* `inference-service-post` span (ID: `a6d293a3971ac955`) also has a duration of 422967ms, which is similar to the previous span.

This suggests that both services are taking a similar amount of time to complete.

**Comparison:**

Based on the analysis, it appears that the root cause of the spiked latency in Trace 1 is likely due to the `inference-span` service. The `preprocess-request` service completes quickly, but the `inference-span` service takes an extremely long time to complete (1207384ms), which causes the overall latency to spike.

In contrast, Trace 2 does not show a significant spike in latency, suggesting that the root cause of the issue may be specific to the first trace.

**Recommendations:**

1. Investigate why the `inference-span` service is taking so long to complete. Is there an issue with the data being processed or a problem with the inference model?
2. Consider optimizing the `preprocess-request` service to reduce its duration, as it is currently completing relatively quickly.
3. If possible, try to identify and fix any issues that may be causing the `inference-span` service to take so long to complete.

By addressing these potential issues, you may be able to resolve the spiked latency issue in Trace 1.%
