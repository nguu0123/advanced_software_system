The traces provided show different services and operations. To identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to compare these traces:

1. The first trace shows a web server processing a request. There are no logs or specific tags associated with this service.

2. The second trace shows an inference server processing a request. This server is part of a pre-processor service. There are logs and specific tags associated with this service.

3. The third trace shows the completion of an inference request. This indicates that the inference process has been completed. There are no logs or specific tags associated with this service.

Based on these traces, it seems that the root cause of the spiked latency is related to the inference server processing requests.

To further investigate and address this issue, you may need to analyze the code and data associated with this service. Additionally, you may need to consult or contact the relevant team or stakeholders for assistance in addressing this issue.%
