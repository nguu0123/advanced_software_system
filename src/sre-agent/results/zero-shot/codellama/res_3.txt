Both traces show a significant increase in latency, but the root cause can be identified by analyzing the operations and tags associated with each span.

In the first trace, the root cause of the spiked latency appears to be the "preprocess-request" operation, which has a duration of 1198196 microseconds (11.98 seconds). This indicates that this operation is responsible for the majority of the latency in the request.

In the second trace, the root cause of the spiked latency appears to be the "inference-service-post" operation, which has a duration of 422967 microseconds (0.423 seconds). This indicates that this operation is responsible for the majority of the latency in the request.

Therefore, based on these traces, it appears that the "preprocess-request" and "inference-service-post" operations are the root causes of the spiked latency in both requests.%
