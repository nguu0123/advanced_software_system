To compare these two traces and identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we can analyze the duration of each span in both traces. The first trace shows a total duration of 1087295 (preprocess-request) + 422967 (inference-service-post) = 1510262 nanoseconds.

The second trace has the following durations:
- preprocess-request: 1198196 ns
- inference-service-post: 422967 ns

Comparing these two traces, we can see that the "inference-server" service (p3) is responsible for a longer duration in both cases. However, to identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need more information about when exactly the latency occurred and which specific operations were affected by it.

In this case, let's assume that the spike in latency was observed during the "inference-service-post" operation (operationName: inference-service-post) of the second trace. This is because its duration is significantly longer than other services and could be a potential root cause for the increased latency.

However, it's important to note that this conclusion might not always hold true as there can be multiple factors contributing to spiked latency in distributed systems like network issues or resource contention among others. To confirm if "inference-server" is indeed the root cause of the spiked latency, you would need more detailed information about when exactly the latency occurred and a deeper analysis of each service's performance during that time period.%
