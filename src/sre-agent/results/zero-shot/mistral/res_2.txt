 To identify the potential root cause of the spiked latency, we can compare the duration times of each operation in both traces. In this case, the "inference-service-post" operation in the second trace has a significantly longer duration time (422967 ms) compared to the same operation in the first trace (0 ms).

This suggests that the "inference-server" service might be the root cause of the spiked latency in the second trace. However, it's important to note that other factors could also contribute to latency, such as network issues or resource constraints. To confirm this hypothesis, further investigation and monitoring would be required.%
