 To identify the potential root cause of the spiked latency, we can compare the duration (time taken) for each operation in both traces. In this case, let's focus on the "inference-service-post" operation as it is present in both traces but has a significantly different duration between them.

1. First trace: The "inference-service-post" operation took 422967 microseconds (approximately 0.423 milliseconds).

2. Second trace: The "inference-service-post" operation took 1,198,196 microseconds (approximately 1.198 milliseconds), which is about 3 times longer than the first trace.

Since the duration of the "inference-service-post" operation is significantly higher in the second trace, it is a potential candidate for the root cause of the spiked latency. However, further investigation would be required to confirm this and identify specific reasons for the increased duration, such as resource contention, code optimization issues, or data processing bottlenecks within the inference service.%
