 To determine the root cause of the spiked latency, we can compare the duration times of each operation in both traces. The trace with the higher durations for certain operations might indicate the service causing the delay.

1. Inference Service (Operation: inference-service-post):
   - Trace 1: Duration = 422967 microseconds
   - Trace 2: Not present in this trace, so we can't compare durations.

Since the Inference Service operation is only present in Trace 1 and has a significantly higher duration, it might be the root cause of the spiked latency in that specific request. However, to confirm this, more data or traces would be needed to ensure that the high latency is consistent for the Inference Service.

Additionally, it's important to note that other services and operations could also contribute to the overall latency, but their impact might not be as noticeable in a single trace comparison. Analyzing multiple traces or monitoring system performance over time can help identify patterns and potential bottlenecks more accurately.%
