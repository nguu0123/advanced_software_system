The traces provided show different services and operations. To identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to analyze these traces in a systematic way.

Based on the information provided, it seems that there are multiple services involved in processing incoming requests for inference.

To pinpoint the exact root cause of the spiked latency, further analysis is required. This could involve analyzing specific logs, metrics, and traces collected during the execution of these services.

In summary, based on the provided traces, it appears that there are multiple services involved in processing incoming requests for inference. Further analysis would be required to pinpoint the exact root cause of the spiked latency.%
