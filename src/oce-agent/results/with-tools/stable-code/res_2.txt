The traces provided show different services and operations. To identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to compare these traces:

1. The first trace shows a web server processing a request. There are no logs or specific tags associated with this service.

2. The second trace shows an inference server handling a request. This server has a job ID associated with it.

3. The third trace shows the pre-processor service starting to process a request.

4. The fourth trace shows that the pre-processor service has completed processing the request.

To identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to compare these traces:

1. If there are specific tags or logs associated with the inference server, then this could be the root cause of the spiked latency.

2. If there are no specific tags or logs associated with the inference server, then it would be necessary to investigate further by examining other services and operations that may be related to the spiked latency.

In conclusion, to identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to compare these traces:

1. If there are specific tags or logs associated with the inference server, then this could be the root cause of the spiked latency.

2. If there are no specific tags or logs associated with the inference server, then it would be necessary to investigate further by examining other services and operations that may be related to the spiked latency.%
