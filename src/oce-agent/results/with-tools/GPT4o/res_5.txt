To determine the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to compare the durations of each span in both traces and identify where the significant increase in time occurs.

### Normal Request Trace
1. **inference-span**
   - Duration: 341,955 microseconds
2. **preprocess-request**
   - Duration: 314,874 microseconds
3. **inference-service-post**
   - Duration: 312,303 microseconds

### Spiked Latency Request Trace
1. **inference-span**
   - Duration: 1,207,384 microseconds
2. **preprocess-request**
   - Duration: 1,198,196 microseconds
3. **inference-service-post**
   - Duration: 422,967 microseconds

### Comparison
- **inference-span**
  - Normal: 341,955 microseconds
  - Spiked: 1,207,384 microseconds
  - Increase: 865,429 microseconds

- **preprocess-request**
  - Normal: 314,874 microseconds
  - Spiked: 1,198,196 microseconds
  - Increase: 883,322 microseconds

- **inference-service-post**
  - Normal: 312,303 microseconds
  - Spiked: 422,967 microseconds
  - Increase: 110,664 microseconds

### Analysis
Both the `inference-span` and `preprocess-request` spans show significant increases in duration, with the `preprocess-request` span having a slightly higher increase. However, the `inference-service-post` span also shows an increase but to a lesser extent.

Given that both `inference-span` and `preprocess-request` have substantial increases, it suggests that the latency issue could be originating from the `preprocess-request` service, which then propagates to the `inference-span`. 

### Conclusion
The root cause of the spiked latency appears to be the `preprocess-request` service, as it shows the highest increase in duration compared to the normal request trace. This service should be investigated further to identify the specific cause of the delay.
