Assistant: To compare the two traces and identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to analyze the spans in each trace.

**Trace 1:**

* The `inference-span` span has a duration of 1207384 seconds (approximately 34.5 minutes), which is significantly longer than the other spans.
* The `preprocess-request` span has a duration of 1198196 seconds (approximately 32.2 minutes), which is also quite long.
* The `inference-service-post` span has a duration of 422967 seconds (approximately 11.3 minutes).

**Trace 2:**

* The `inference-span` span has a duration of 1207384 seconds (approximately 34.5 minutes), which is the same as in Trace 1.
* The `preprocess-request` span has a duration of 1198196 seconds (approximately 32.2 minutes), which is also the same as in Trace 1.
* However, the `inference-service-post` span has a much shorter duration of 422967 seconds (approximately 11.3 minutes).

Based on these observations, it appears that the `preprocess-request` service is the root cause of the spiked latency in both traces. The long durations of this service indicate that it is taking an unusually long time to complete, which is causing the overall latency to spike.

The `inference-service-post` service has a shorter duration in Trace 2, suggesting that it may have been optimized or improved since the last measurement, and its performance is now more consistent.

Therefore, if I had to identify the root cause of the spiked latency, I would focus on optimizing the `preprocess-request` service to reduce its duration.
