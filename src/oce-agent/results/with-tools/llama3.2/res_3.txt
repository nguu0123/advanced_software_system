Assistant: To identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to analyze both traces and look for potential bottlenecks or performance issues.

**Trace 1:**

The first trace shows a successful response with a duration of 1207384ms. The spans in this trace are:

* `preprocess-request`: 1198196ms (almost the entire duration)
* `inference-service-post`: 422967ms
* `File saved` and `Inference completed` are short-lived events that don't seem to contribute significantly to the overall latency.

The `preprocess-request` span is quite long, which might indicate a performance issue in this step. However, without more context, it's difficult to say if this is the root cause of the spiked latency.

**Trace 2:**

The second trace also shows a successful response with a duration of 1207384ms. The spans in this trace are:

* `preprocess-request`: 1198196ms (almost the entire duration)
* `inference-service-post`: 422967ms
* `File saved` and `Inference completed` are short-lived events that don't seem to contribute significantly to the overall latency.

Similar to Trace 1, the `preprocess-request` span is quite long, which might indicate a performance issue in this step. However, without more context, it's difficult to say if this is the root cause of the spiked latency.

**Comparison:**

Both traces show similar patterns:

* The `preprocess-request` span is almost identical in both traces (1198196ms vs 1198196ms).
* The `inference-service-post` span is also similar (422967ms vs 422967ms).

This suggests that the performance issue might be related to the `preprocess-request` step, which is executed by both services. However, without more context or information about the specific tasks performed in this step, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the spiked latency.

**Next steps:**

To further investigate the root cause of the spiked latency, you might want to:

1. Analyze the `preprocess-request` step in more detail, including any dependencies or interactions with other services.
2. Check if there are any issues with the data being processed or if there are any errors that could be causing the performance issue.
3. Consider adding additional logging or monitoring to gather more information about the performance of each service and identify potential bottlenecks.

By taking a closer look at the `preprocess-request` step, you may be able to identify the root cause of the spiked latency and take corrective action to improve the overall performance of your services
