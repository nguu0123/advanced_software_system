Assistant: To compare the two traces and identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to analyze the spans and logs in both traces.

**Trace 1:**

* The `inference-span` span has a duration of 1207384ms, which is unusually long.
* The `preprocess-request` span has a duration of 1198196ms, which is also longer than usual.
* The `inference-service-post` span has a duration of 422967ms, which is relatively short compared to the other two spans.

**Trace 2:**

* The `inference-span` span has a duration of 1207384ms, which is identical to Trace 1.
* The `preprocess-request` span has a duration of 1198196ms, which is also identical to Trace 1.
* The `inference-service-post` span has a duration of 422967ms, which is relatively short compared to the other two spans.

**Comparison:**

Both traces show that the `inference-span` and `preprocess-request` spans have long durations, suggesting that these services are taking a significant amount of time to complete. However, the `inference-service-post` span has a shorter duration in both traces, which suggests that this service is not the root cause of the spiked latency.

**Root Cause:**

Based on the analysis, it appears that the `preprocess-request` service is the root cause of the spiked latency. The long duration of this span suggests that there may be an issue with the preprocessing step, such as a slow database query or a complex algorithm that is taking too much time to complete.

To further investigate, we can look at the logs and see if there are any errors or warnings related to the `preprocess-request` service. We can also check the performance metrics of this service to see if it is consistently slow or if it is an intermittent issue.

**Recommendations:**

1. Investigate the `preprocess-request` service to identify the root cause of the long duration.
2. Optimize the preprocessing step to reduce its impact on the overall latency.
3. Monitor the performance metrics of the `preprocess-request` service to ensure that it is not consistently slow.

By following these steps, we can identify the root cause of the spiked latency and take corrective action to improve the performance of the system.
