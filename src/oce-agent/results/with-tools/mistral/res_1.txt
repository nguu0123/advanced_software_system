Assistant:  Based on the provided traces, it appears that the latency spike might be related to the "inference-service" (service with ID p3). Here's why:

1. In the first trace, the latency is within acceptable limits for both the web server (p1) and preprocessor (p2) services. The inference service (p3) also has a reasonable latency.

2. In the second trace, the latency for the web server (p1) and preprocessor (p2) services remains within acceptable limits. However, the latency for the inference service (p3) significantly increases compared to the first trace. This increase in latency could be the root cause of the spiked latency observed in the second trace.

To further confirm this, you might want to investigate the following:
- Check if there are any changes or issues specific to the "inference-service" that occurred between the two traces.
- Analyze the logs and metrics related to the "inference-service" during the time of the latency spike.
- Consider performing load testing on the "inference-service" to see if it can handle the expected traffic without experiencing such latency spikes.
- If necessary, consult with the team responsible for maintaining the "inference-service" to identify any potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization.
