Based on the provided traces, it appears that the "preprocess-request" operation in the "p2" process (service name: pre-processor) and the "inference-service-post" operation in the "p3" process (service name: inference-server) are taking significantly longer than expected.

The first trace shows a spike in latency during the `preprocess-request` operation, which is part of the pre-processor service ("p2"). The second trace also indicates that there's an issue with the "inference-service-post" operation in the inference server process ("p3").

To identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to look at the duration and start time for each span. In the first trace:

1. The `preprocess-request` operation has a high duration (1198196) which is significantly higher than its previous run's duration (422967). This indicates that this service might be causing the latency spike.

In the second trace, we can see that the "inference-service-post" operation also has a high duration of 422967 and it is referenced in the first trace as well (refType: CHILD_OF). This indicates that this service might be contributing to the latency spike.

To confirm which one is the root cause, we need more information about the system's performance metrics or additional traces for a broader context. However, based on the provided data, it appears that both "pre-processor" and "inference-server" services could be contributing to the latency spike.

To further investigate, you can analyze the duration of each operation in relation to their previous runs or compare them with other traces from different time periods for a more accurate conclusion.%
