Based on the provided traces, it seems that there are three services involved in this trace: web-server (p1), pre-processor (p2) and inference-service. The first step would be to analyze the duration of each operation within these traces. In Trace A, the "inference" service has a significantly longer duration than its references or child spans, which indicates that it is likely the root cause for the latency issue.

In this case, we can see that:

- The 'web-server' (p1) process took 250ms to complete and had no errors or warnings.
- The 'preprocess-request' operation in the 'pre-processor' (p2) service took 1198196 ms, which is significantly longer than its child span of 422967 ms from the 'inference-service-post' operation. This indicates that this process could be a potential root cause for the latency spike as well.

However, to definitively determine the root cause, we need more information about the system and how these services interact with each other.

In general, you can compare the duration of operations in both traces:
- 'web-server' (p1) took a total of 250ms + 422967 ms = 423467 ms
- 'pre-processor' (p2) took a total of 1198196 ms
- 'inference-service' (p3) had a duration of 422967ms.

Based on the information provided, it seems that both 'web-server' and 'preprocess-request' in the 'pre-processor' service are potential root causes for the spiked latency as they have high durations compared to their child processes or references.

However, without more context about how these services interact with each other, it is difficult to definitively determine which one is the primary cause of the spike in latency. It's possible that both are contributing factors and further investigation would be needed to identify if there are any bottlenecks or issues within those processes themselves.

To better understand this, we can look at the duration of each operation:
- 'web-server' (p1) took a total of 250ms + 422967 ms = 423417 ms
- 'preprocess-request' in the 'pre-processor' service (p2) had a duration of 1198196 ms.
- 'inference-service-post' operation took 422967ms, which is significantly longer than its parent span or any other process. This suggests that this could be the root cause for the latency spik
