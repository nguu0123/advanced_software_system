To identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we can compare the two traces and look for any significant differences in the duration of the spans and the timestamps of the logs.

In the normal request trace, the total duration of the spans is relatively low, with the "inference-service-post" span having a duration of 312303 and the "preprocess-request" span having a duration of 314874.

In the spiked latency request trace, the total duration of the spans is significantly higher, with the "inference-span" span having a duration of 1207384 and the "preprocess-request" span having a duration of 1198196.

This indicates that the "inference-span" is the root cause of the spiked latency, as it has a much higher duration compared to the normal request trace.

Therefore, the "inference-span" service is the likely root cause of the spiked latency in the request. Further investigation into the performance of the "inference-span" service is recommended to identify and address the underlying issue causing the latency spike.
