To determine the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to compare the durations of each span in both traces. Here are the details:

### Normal Request Trace
1. **inference-span**
   - Duration: 341,955 microseconds
2. **preprocess-request**
   - Duration: 314,874 microseconds
3. **inference-service-post**
   - Duration: 312,303 microseconds

### Spiked Latency Trace
1. **inference-span**
   - Duration: 1,207,384 microseconds
2. **preprocess-request**
   - Duration: 1,198,196 microseconds
3. **inference-service-post**
   - Duration: 422,967 microseconds

### Comparison

1. **inference-span**
   - Normal: 341,955 microseconds
   - Spiked: 1,207,384 microseconds
   - Increase: 865,429 microseconds

2. **preprocess-request**
   - Normal: 314,874 microseconds
   - Spiked: 1,198,196 microseconds
   - Increase: 883,322 microseconds

3. **inference-service-post**
   - Normal: 312,303 microseconds
   - Spiked: 422,967 microseconds
   - Increase: 110,664 microseconds

### Conclusion
The significant increase in latency is observed in both the `inference-span` and `preprocess-request` spans. However, the `preprocess-request` span shows a slightly higher increase in duration compared to the `inference-span`.

- **preprocess-request**: Increase of 883,322 microseconds
- **inference-span**: Increase of 865,429 microseconds

Given these observations, the **preprocess-request** service appears to be the primary contributor to the spiked latency.
