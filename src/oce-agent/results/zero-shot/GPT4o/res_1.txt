To identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to compare the durations of each service in both traces. Here are the details:

### Normal Request Trace:
1. **inference-span** (web-server)
   - Duration: 341,955 microseconds

2. **preprocess-request** (pre-processor)
   - Duration: 314,874 microseconds

3. **inference-service-post** (inference-server)
   - Duration: 312,303 microseconds

### Spiked Latency Request Trace:
1. **inference-span** (web-server)
   - Duration: 1,207,384 microseconds

2. **preprocess-request** (pre-processor)
   - Duration: 1,198,196 microseconds

3. **inference-service-post** (inference-server)
   - Duration: 422,967 microseconds

### Comparison:
1. **inference-span** (web-server)
   - Normal: 341,955 microseconds
   - Spiked: 1,207,384 microseconds
   - Increase: 865,429 microseconds

2. **preprocess-request** (pre-processor)
   - Normal: 314,874 microseconds
   - Spiked: 1,198,196 microseconds
   - Increase: 883,322 microseconds

3. **inference-service-post** (inference-server)
   - Normal: 312,303 microseconds
   - Spiked: 422,967 microseconds
   - Increase: 110,664 microseconds

### Conclusion:
Both the **web-server** and **pre-processor** services show significant increases in their durations, with the **pre-processor** service having a slightly higher increase (883,322 microseconds) compared to the **web-server** (865,429 microseconds). The **inference-server** also shows an increase, but it is much smaller (110,664 microseconds) compared to the other two services.

Therefore, the root cause of the spiked latency appears to be primarily due to the **pre-processor** service, with a significant contribution from the **web-server** service as well.
