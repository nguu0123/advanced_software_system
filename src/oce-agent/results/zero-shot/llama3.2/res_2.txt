To compare the two traces and identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to analyze the spans in each trace.

**Trace 1:**

* `p1` (Web Server):
        + `preprocess-request`: duration = 1198196ms
        + `inference-service-post`: duration = 422967ms
        + `File saved`, `Starting inference`, and `Inference completed` events are all within the duration of `preprocess-request`
* `p2` (Pre-Processor):
        + `preprocess-request`: duration = 1198196ms
        + `successful_response` event is within the duration of `preprocess-request`
* `p3` (Inference Server):
        + `inference-service-post`: duration = 1207384ms
        + `File saved`, `Starting inference`, and `Inference completed` events are all within the duration of `inference-service-post`

**Trace 2:**

* `p1` (Web Server):
        + `preprocess-request`: duration = 1207384ms
        + `successful_response` event is within the duration of `preprocess-request`
* `p2` (Pre-Processor):
        + `preprocess-request`: duration = 1207384ms
        + `successful_response` event is within the duration of `preprocess-request`
* `p3` (Inference Server):
        + `inference-service-post`: duration = 422967ms
        + `File saved`, `Starting inference`, and `Inference completed` events are all within the duration of `inference-service-post`

From the analysis, we can see that:

* In Trace 1, both `preprocess-request` and `inference-service-post` have long durations, but they do not overlap. This suggests that the latency is caused by one of these services.
* In Trace 2, both `preprocess-request` and `inference-service-post` have short durations, and they overlap with each other. This suggests that the latency is likely caused by the overlap between these two services.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the root cause of the spiked latency is the overlap between the `preprocess-request` and `inference-service-post` spans in both traces. However, without more information about the specific services and their interactions, we cannot determine which service is causing the latency.

To further investigate, you may want to:

* Analyze the logs and metrics of each service to understand what's happening during the long durations.
* Use tracing tools to visualize the call graph between services and identify any bottlenecks or performance issues.
* Implement additional logging or monitoring to capture more detailed information about the latency spikes.%
