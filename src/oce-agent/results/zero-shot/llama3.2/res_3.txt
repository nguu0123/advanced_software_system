To compare the two traces and identify the root cause of the spiked latency, we need to analyze the spans in each trace.

**Trace 1:**

* `p1` (web-server) has a span with duration 1207384, which is likely the root cause of the spiked latency.
        + This span has a downstream effect on `p2` (pre-processor), which also has a span with duration 1198196. However, this span does not seem to be the root cause of the latency spike.
* `p2` (pre-processor) has a span with duration 1198196, but it is not the root cause of the latency spike.

**Trace 2:**

* `p3` (inference-server) has a span with duration 422967, which is significantly shorter than the duration in Trace 1.
        + This span has a downstream effect on `p2` (pre-processor), which also has a span with duration 1198196. However, this span does not seem to be the root cause of the latency spike.

Based on these observations, it appears that the root cause of the spiked latency is likely in the `p1` (web-server) service. The long-running span in `p1` is causing a downstream effect on `p2` and potentially other services, leading to the latency spike.

To further investigate, you may want to:

* Check the logs of `p1` to see if there are any errors or issues that could be causing the long-running span.
* Analyze the network latency between `p1` and `p2` to ensure that it is not a bottleneck.
* Consider optimizing the workflow in `p1` to reduce the duration of the long-running span.

Note: This analysis assumes that the traces are accurate and complete, and that there are no other services or components involved in the latency spike.%
