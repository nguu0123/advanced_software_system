Both traces have a similar structure, with each span representing a different service. However, there are some differences in the traces that can help identify the root cause of the spiked latency:

1. In the first trace, the "preprocess-request" span has a much longer duration than the other two spans, indicating that this service is responsible for the majority of the latency.
2. In the second trace, the "inference-service-post" span also has a long duration, but it is not as long as the "preprocess-request" span. This suggests that the inference service may be the root cause of the spiked latency, as it is responsible for processing the input data and generating the output.
3. The traces also show different levels of concurrency, with the first trace having a higher level of concurrency than the second trace. This could indicate that there are more concurrent requests being processed in the first trace, which may be causing the spiked latency.
4. Additionally, the traces show different levels of CPU usage, with the first trace having a higher level of CPU usage than the second trace. This could also contribute to the spiked latency, as high CPU usage can lead to increased context switching and decreased performance.

Based on these differences, it appears that the "preprocess-request" service is the root cause of the spiked latency in both traces. This suggests that there may be issues with the preprocessing step, such as a bottleneck or a high volume of requests being processed simultaneously.%
