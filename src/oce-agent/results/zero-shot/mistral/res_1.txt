 To determine the potential root cause of the spiked latency, we can compare the duration times of each operation in both traces.

1. The first trace shows a normal response time:
   - `inference-service-post` operation took 422967 microseconds (approximately 0.423 milliseconds)
   - `preprocess-request` operation took 1198196 microseconds (approximately 1.198 milliseconds)
   - `inference-request` operation took 1198196 microseconds (approximately 1.198 milliseconds)

2. The second trace shows a spiked response time:
   - `inference-service-post` operation took 422967 microseconds (approximately 0.423 milliseconds), which is within the normal range
   - `preprocess-request` operation took 1198196 microseconds (approximately 1.198 milliseconds), which is the same as in the first trace, but it's not the root cause of the spiked latency since the `inference-service-post` operation time remains normal
   - `inference-request` operation took 1254063 microseconds (approximately 1.254 milliseconds), which is significantly higher than in the first trace, suggesting that this operation might be the root cause of the spiked latency

However, since we don't have more context about the system and operations, it's essential to investigate further by analyzing logs, monitoring metrics, and possibly profiling the code execution for the `inference-request` operation.%
