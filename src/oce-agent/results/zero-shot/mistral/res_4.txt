 To identify the potential root cause of the spiked latency, we can compare the duration of each operation in both traces. The trace with the higher durations for certain operations might indicate the service causing the delay.

In this case, let's focus on the "inference" service as it has multiple operations associated with it:

1. `inference-service-post`: This operation is present in both traces, but its duration (422967 ms) in the trace with spiked latency is significantly higher than the one without spikes (not provided).

   However, it's important to note that the "preprocess-request" operation, which is a child of `inference-service-post`, also has a higher duration (1198196 ms) in the trace with spiked latency compared to the one without spikes (not provided).

   Since the `preprocess-request` operation is directly related to the "inference" service, it might be the root cause of the spike in latency. However, further investigation would be required to confirm this, as there could be other factors at play affecting the performance of the "inference" service.

   To investigate further, you may want to look into the implementation details of the preprocessing step and consider optimizing it if possible. Additionally, monitoring the system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) during the execution of this operation could help identify any bottlenecks.%
